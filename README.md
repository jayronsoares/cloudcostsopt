# Cloud Cost Optimization Demo

## Purpose
The Cloud Cost Optimization Demo is a web application designed to showcase the potential cost savings and optimization opportunities within a cloud computing environment. It allows users to input cost-related parameters for different cloud services (EC2, RDS, and S3) and compare the costs before and after optimization. This demonstration is intended to help software and data engineers understand the importance of cloud cost optimization and make informed decisions to reduce operational expenses.

## Features

### 1. EC2 Cost Comparison
- **Input Parameters:**
  - Cost per Virtual Machine per Hour
  - Number of Continuous Virtual Machines
